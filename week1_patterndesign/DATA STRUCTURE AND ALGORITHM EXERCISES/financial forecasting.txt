1. Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. In financial forecasting, recursion can simplify the process of calculating compounded values by reducing each period step-by-step until a base case is reached.

In this code:

ForecastFutureValue() is a recursive method.

The base case is when periods == 0, returning the initial value.

The recursive case applies one period of growth and calls itself with periods - 1.

4. Analysis
Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of periods.

Each recursive call handles one period, so the total number of calls is n.
